# HTML-CSS-Course: Building the Foundation of Web Development
## In the HTML-CSS Course, I acquired essential skills to lay the groundwork for successful web development
- HTML and CSS foundation - I gained a deep understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the fundamental languages of the web. With HTML, I learned to structure content, creating the backbone of web pages with elements, tags, and semantic markup. CSS allowed me to enhance the appearance and layout of these pages, using selectors, properties, and values to apply styles and create visually appealing designs.
- Bootstrap - the world's most popular front-end framework - I learned Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities and how to streamline the development process and create websites that adapt seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes.
  
By learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I am now equipped with the essential skills to create professional-looking websites that are both visually captivating and functionally robust. The knowledge gained from this course serves as a solid foundation for my journey into the dynamic field of web development.
